    <h1>CSCI 711 Project: Creating art-directable rain using OpenUSD & Hydra</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Most rendering systems for rain are based on Physics simulations.
            The positions of the droplets are based on prior velocities, acceleration etc.
            This requires keeping track of a lot of data and performing a lot of calculations at every step,
            which can be expensive. It also doesn't provide a lot of control to the artist in terms of the
            movement of the rain. The goal of this project is to create a system that will render rain
            only using time data - without needing to keep track of velocities, acceleration etc.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>The project will utilize the concept of B-Spline curves to render rain.
            The idea is that the artist can provide a set of control points, which
            our program will interpolate with to create a curve. We will then sample
            points along that curve to determine the positions of the droplets. We
            will vary the sampling location along the curve based on the time/frame number.
            We will render the droplets by using reflectance properties of water.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>System</h2>
        <p>The project was built using OpenUSD and Hydra.
            Universal Scene Description (USD) is a framework for
            interchange of 3D computer graphics data, developed by Pixar Animation
            Studios. Hydra is an open source rendering framework to 
            transport live scene graph data to renderers. Since these technologies
            are gaining increasing popularity in the animation industry, this project
            benefitted from utilizing them. They also make it easy to work with different
            renderers and 3D modelling software, making them very convenient platforms.
            The project involved creating a custom USD Schema and a Hydra imaging adapter for artâ€“directable rain.
